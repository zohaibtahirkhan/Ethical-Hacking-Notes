gobuster dir -u http://[url]  -w [path of wordlist]
        here dir stands for directory, -u stands for url, -w is wordlist placed in linux
        it is a good practice to find the nested directories, mean if i find a subdmain do run gobuster again
        on that subdomain 
        locate dirbuster
        (/usr/share/wordlists/)
