nmap [Scan Type(s)] [Options] [Target(s)]

Scan Types
----------
Ping Scan (-sP): Discover live hosts using ICMP echo requests.
TCP SYN Scan (-sS): Stealthy scan using SYN packets to identify open ports.
TCP Connect Scan (-sT): Fully connects to ports to determine openness.
UDP Scan (-sU): Scan for open UDP ports.
Version Detection (-sV): Attempt to determine service and version info.
ACK Scan (-sA): Identify firewall rules using ACK packets.
XMAS Scan (-sX): Send packets with multiple flags to probe ports.
FIN, NULL, and XMAS Scans (-sF, -sN, -sX): Probe for open ports.
And more...

Common Options
--------------
-p <port range>: Specify ports to scan (e.g., -p 22,80-100).
-T<0-5>: Set timing template for scan speed.
--max-rtt-timeout <milliseconds>: Sets the maximum round-trip time (RTT) for a probe response.
--min-rtt-timeout <milliseconds>: Sets the minimum RTT for a probe response.
-oN <filename>: Save results in normal (text) format.
-oX <filename>: Save results in XML format.
-A: Enable aggressive scan options.
-v, -vv: Increase verbosity for more output detail.
-v verbose
-vv very verbose
--script <script>: Run specific NSE scripts for additional testing.
And many more options for customization.

Target Specification
--------------------
Single Host: nmap <host>           =>Specify a single target host using its IP address or hostname. e.g 192.168.1.1
Host Range: nmap <start-end>	   =>Define a range of IP addresses using hyphens (e.g., 192.168.1.1-10)
CIDR Notation: nmap <CIDR>         =>Use CIDR notation to specify a network range (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
List of Hosts: nmap -iL <file>     => e.g., nmap -iL targets.txt
Excluding Hosts: --exclude <host1,host2,...>

Output Formats
--------------
-oN <filename>: Normal (text) format.
-oX <filename>: XML format.
-oG <filename>: Greppable format.
-oA <basename>: All formats with specified base name.
=> use xsltproc to comvert xml to html file e.g xsltproc defaultSCAN.xml -o defaultSCAN.html

Advanced Techniques
-------------------
=>Tracerouting
--traceroute: Perform traceroute to discover network path.
"""The --traceroute option performs a traceroute to the target host, revealing the path that network packets 
take from your machine to the target and back. This can help you understand the network topology, identify 
potential bottlenecks, and analyze the routing path. Traceroute also shows the IP addresses and hostnames of 
intermediate routers. """ 
   => syntax nmap --traceroute <target>
 
=> MAC Spoofing
--spoof-mac <MAC>: Spoof MAC address in Ethernet frames.
"""You can use the --spoof-mac option to spoof your MAC address when sending packets during scans. 
This can help you avoid detection or confuse network security systems that rely on MAC address filtering or 
tracking. Be cautious when using this technique, as MAC spoofing can have legal and ethical implications."""
   => syntax nmap --spoof-mac <MAC> <target>

=> Time to Live
--ttl <value>: Set IP time-to-live field for outgoing packets.
"""The --ttl option allows you to set the IP time-to-live (TTL) value in outgoing packets. 
TTL specifies the number of hops a packet can make before being discarded. By adjusting the TTL value, 
you can observe how network devices handle packets with different TTL values, potentially revealing more about 
the network structure."""
   => syntax nmap --ttl <value> <target>

=> Fragmentation
"""The --mtu option lets you specify the maximum transmission unit (MTU) size for outgoing packets. 
This can be useful for testing how network devices handle fragmented packets or for evading intrusion detection 
systems that might not handle fragmented packets effectively."""
    => syntax nmap --mtu <value> <target>

=>Decoy Scan
"""Decoy scans involve sending packets from multiple source IP addresses in addition to your own. 
This technique can make it harder for target systems to identify the actual source of the scan. The -D option 
allows you to specify decoy IP addresses. The last address in the list can be your actual IP address or "ME" to 
exclude it from decoys."""
   => syntax nmap -D <decoy1,decoy2[,ME]> <target>

Firewall Evasion Techniques
---------------------------
nmap provides several techniques to potentially bypass or evade firewall rules and intrusion detection systems:

--flood: Sends packets as fast as possible to overwhelm a target system's resources.
--reason: Displays the reason for the port status (open, closed, filtered, etc.).
--source-port <port>: Specifies a source port number for outgoing packets.
--data-length <length>: Sets a custom data length for packets.

=> These techniques can be used to test the robustness of your own firewall rules or to assess the effectiveness 
of security measures in target networks. However, use them carefully and ethically, as they can potentially disrupt 
network services.

Service and Version Detection
-----------------------------
-sV: Attempt to determine service and version info.
--version-intensity <level>: Specify version detection intensity.

OS Detection
-------------
-O: Enable operating system detection.
--osscan-limit: Limit OS detection to promising targets.

NSE Scripts
-----------
Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) allows custom scripts for additional functionality like vulnerability scanning, brute forcing, etc. Use --script <script> to use specific scripts.
e.g., sudo nmap -v -n -Pn -p139,445 -sV -script="smb-vuln*" 192.168.10.4
=> you can also provide arguments to script
e.g., nmap -Pn -n -sV --open 192.168.216.130 192.168.216.131 --script "ssh*" --script-args userdb=user, passdb=pass -p22 -v

=> ip a , tell ip address
=> nmap -v -sn [ip] | grep -v "host down" , shows the result only for live host
=> nmap -v -n -Pn [ip] , -n means don't search the ip in dns and -Pn skips the host discovery
=> nmap -v -n -Pn -p 80 [ip]  or  -p 1-2000  or  -sU/-sT (for upd or tcp ports) , -sV for version and 
    -sV -sC (use both) to run the scripts on the ports
    .nse are nmap scripts
=> nmap -v -n -Pn --script=default [ip] , run the namp script on the port , or --script=http.enum.nse
    we can also run the multiple scripts at the same time by using comma 
    or --script=http-vuln-cve* run all teh scripts start with this name 

    

=> nbtscan [ip] ,   get the NetBIOS name

--open --randomize-hosts -Tinsane
