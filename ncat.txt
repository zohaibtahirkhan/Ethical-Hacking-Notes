NCAT
----
Ncat is an improved and extended version of the original `netcat` (often referred to as `nc`). 
It provides enhanced security features, improved performance, and additional functionality. `Ncat` is a part of the 
Nmap project and is designed to be more reliable and powerful than the traditional `netcat`.

Syntax
------
ncat [options] host port

ncat: The command to invoke `ncat`.
[options]: Various command-line options you can provide to customize `ncat`'s behavior.
host: The target host you want to connect to or bind on.
port: The port number on the host you want to connect to or listen on.

Options
-------

-l: Listen mode. This tells `ncat` to listen for incoming connections.
-p [port]: Specify the port number to use when listening or connecting.
-u: Use UDP instead of the default TCP.
-k: Accept multiple connections in listen mode.
--ssl: Enable SSL/TLS encryption for the connection.
--ssl-cert <file>: Specify the SSL certificate file.
--ssl-key <file>: Specify the SSL private key file.
--exec <command>: Execute a command and redirect its input/output to the network connection.
--proxy <proxy>: Use a proxy server for connecting.

Examples
--------
1. Simple Connection: To connect to a remote host and port using TCP, you would use:
   => ncat host_name_or_ip port_number

2. Listen for Connections: To set up `ncat` to listen for incoming connections on a specific port:
   => ncat -l -p port_number

3. UDP Connection: To use UDP instead of TCP:
   => ncat -u host_name_or_ip port_number

4. Secure Connection: To establish an SSL/TLS-encrypted connection:
   => ncat --ssl host_name_or_ip port_number

5. Execute Command: You can use `ncat` to execute a command and redirect its input/output to the network connection:
   => ncat -l -p port_number --exec "/bin/sh"
